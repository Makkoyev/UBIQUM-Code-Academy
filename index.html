        <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency
          is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens
          hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
          transparent.</p>
        <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and
          spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good
          and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
          about what their Government is doing.</p>
        <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
          effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
          and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
          our site to become actively engaged in American government.</p>
        <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
          public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

        <h1> <strong>Background History of Government Transparency</strong> </h1>
      </section>
      <section class="main-content">
        <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
          opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack
          on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of
          formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example,
          (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
          part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the
          philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
          public sphere. </p>
        <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of
          the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
          press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to
          row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and
          writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>
        <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often
          linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
          adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to
          the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence
          in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation
          in 1999).</p>
        <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information
          Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
